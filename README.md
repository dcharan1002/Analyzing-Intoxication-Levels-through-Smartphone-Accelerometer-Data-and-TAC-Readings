# Analyzing-Intoxication-Levels-through-Smartphone-Accelerometer-Data-and-TAC-Readings
This project aims to detect heavy drinking patterns by analyzing smartphone accelerometer data and transdermal alcohol content (TAC) measurements. By correlating movement data with TAC readings, it seeks to develop a predictive model for identifying intoxication.
